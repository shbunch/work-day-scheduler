# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project showcases a small calendar scheduler for the current day that will allow the user to add an event and save it.

This assignment helped me with the following concepts:<br>
-Utilizing the jQuery library as opposed to vanilla JavaScript<br>
-Saving text input to the local storage<br>
-Using the dayJS library to deal with unique date and time formats.<br>

## Usage
